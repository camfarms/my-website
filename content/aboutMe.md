# Hi there

My name is Cameron Farmer, and I would like to tell you a little bit about myself! But before I
do, here are some quick links to my [resume](/CF_Resume_pdf.pdf) and [unofficial transcript](/unofficial_transcript.pdf).

I am a graduate of Case Western Reserve University with a BS in
Computer Science. My professional interests lie within the realm of Software Development -- I 
am a maker, and I desire a future career that enables me to make bigger and better applications. 
I also have a keen interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence, and will be seeking an
appropriate Master's degree program. 

With my recent graduation, I have been considering my post-graduation options and have come 
up with two 5-year goals to give me some direction: 
- **Live in another country** and learn the native language (assuming it's not English)
- **Earn a Master's degree in machine learning**, preferably in an international program 

In order to achieve these goals, I have been applying to both professional and academic 
opportunities across the globe in countries such as Israel and Germany. I have also been giving special consideration to international companies in hopes of starting work in the United States before requesting a transfer to a foreign office.
