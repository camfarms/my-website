## Intro

Following my Freshman year at Case Wester Reserve University, I was hired as an intern for a local software development company called Solution Street. At Solution Street I had the opportunity to work with a team entirely composed of interns (except for our team lead) on an entirely new project! This presented a unique learning opportunity and taught me so much more about software development beyond the technical details. 

As a team, we were tasked with creating a new web-based application for a local catering company -- Smokin' Willy's BBQ! The owner of Smokin' Willy's was having trouble managing a increasing number of orders and came to Solution Street looking for a business solution. A deal was struck between the two and a team of 4 interns and 1 part-time employee got to work on an application in exchange for free catering at future company picnics!
