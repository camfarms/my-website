## Week 1

Jake and I touched down at the Venice Marco Polo Airport on August 15th after traveling for 18 hours from Washington D.C.'s Dulles Airport. Soon after landing, our friend Alessandro from Padova (a small city outside of Venice) picked us up in his tiny car. A 20 minute car ride later, we arrived at the Padova train station and picked up Rachel. The gang was finally all together!

Needless to say, Jake and I were exhausted and SUPER jetlagged... so that first day was a little rough and we ended up falling asleep while exploring Padova.

So, day one was a bit of a wash. Oh well! 

### Verona

Our first day trip was to the city of Verona, the home of Romeo and Juliet!

### 52 Galleries

Next on our list was a roadtrip to [52 galleries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strada_delle_52_Gallerie) which is a series of 52 tunnels through the alps in Northern Italy. It is a historical site from WWI when it was used as a trail for munitions, but it also happens to be a beautiful hike!

### Venice

Being so close, we of course spent multiple days in Venice. Our first day we made no plans, and simply wandered around and explored the winding, narrow footpaths between buildings hundreds of years old. While in Venice we had tons of fun seeing historical landmarks, eating amazing food, and  drinking delicious (and cheap!) wine.

#### Murano and Burano

>Murano and Burano are two of the most famous Venetian islands which are known for their beautiful glasswork and colorful homefronts respectively.

### Trip to the "Beach"

I think there may have been something lost in translation with this one... Ale told Jake and me that he was taking us to "the beach", but what we infect went to was an *ice-cold mountain stream* where people gather to go cliff jumping. But, regardless of the fact that I brought my volleyball, we still had an amazing time. Jake and I quickly worked our way up to the highest jump off points and started practicing our swan dives. Joining the three of us were Ale's three friends Alcia, Helena, and Martina.
