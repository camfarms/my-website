It has been a long term goal of mine to move to and live in another country for at least a year. My family has hosted a number of exchange students throughout the past decade from all over Europe. After meeting some many people from other countries, I have had instilled in me a deep desire to experience another country and culture. 

Right now I am applying to graduate programs abroad. My top three programs are based in Israel, Germany, and Switzerland. Before accepting any offers of enrollment, however, I need to some research to learn what it is like to be a foreigner in that country. 

I must consider the following: 
- Feelings towards Americans -- welcoming to hostile?
- Networking, i.e. can I only network with companies in that country? 
- Similarly, employment rates for international students in and out of the country
- Social culture, dating
