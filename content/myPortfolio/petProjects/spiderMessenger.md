## Intro

After taking a course on computer security I became more and more interested with the concepts of data integrity and privacy. At the time, the messenger *Telegram* was in the news and I found myself talking with my friend Cade about the idea of a secure messenger application. We decided it was a really cool concept and would pose some interesting challenges to build, so we got to work!

Cade was interested in using *SvelteKit* to build the application and I was more than happy to learn how to use a new framework. Cade also learned about this decentralized database called *Gun* that was accessed using a JavaScript API. Once we had decided on our tools for our application we got to work on *Spider* -- a messenger application built in *SvelteKit* that utilizes *GunDB*.
